 instagram clone built with Javascript
GrazeAGram
This is a simple social media website called GrazeAGram that allows users to post pictures of sheep and interact with other users by liking and sharing their posts. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What I Did
I created the basic structure of the website using HTML, including the header, main content area, and footer. I also added some basic styles to make the website look more appealing, such as setting the font and background color.

Using CSS, I styled the header to include a logo and user avatar, and added styles for the main feed area where users can post pictures of sheep. I also used CSS to make the website responsive, so that it looks good on different screen sizes.

Finally, I used JavaScript to dynamically render the sheep posts in the main feed area. When the page loads, the JavaScript fetches data from a file and uses it to create HTML elements for each sheep post, including the image, post text, and like/share buttons. Users can interact with the posts by clicking the buttons to like or share them.

What I Learned
Through building this website, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic social media website. I also learned how to fetch data by importing and exporting using JavaScript and dynamically render it on the page.
